# AURA Deep Dive: Intelligent Feature Extraction & Collaborative Tool Utilization

This document outlines AURA's approach to understanding the capabilities of integrated software and collaborating with the user to define how these capabilities are best leveraged. This process moves beyond simple tool execution to enable true AI-driven workflows.

## Introduction

Once a new tool or software is onboarded into the AURA framework via the "Universal Adapter Bay" (i.e., AURA knows how to install and execute it), a critical next step is to understand *what the tool can do* at a feature level. Following this discovery, AURA engages the user in a collaborative dialogue to determine *how these features should be used*, potentially in novel ways orchestrated by the AI.

This process is divided into two main phases:

1.  **Phase 1: Automated Feature Discovery & Understanding**
2.  **Phase 2: Collaborative Utilization Definition with the User**

## Phase 1: Automated Feature Discovery & Understanding

After successful onboarding, AURA's `RepoIntel Agent`, in conjunction with the core LLM, performs a deeper analysis to identify and catalogue the tool's specific features.

### 1.1. Initial Source Review
* **Manifest Data:** Leverages the `description` and any preliminary command/argument information gathered during the onboarding process (from an `aura_skill.json` or heuristic analysis).
* **Purpose:** Provides a foundational understanding of the tool's general purpose.

### 1.2. LLM-Powered Documentation Deep Dive
* **Semantic Analysis:** The core LLM processes `README` files, `INSTALL/USAGE` guides, wikis, man pages, and other available documentation.
* **Focus:** Identifies verbs, nouns, and phrases describing distinct actions, functionalities, use cases, and expected outcomes (e.g., "convert image format," "generate statistical report," "edit video metadata").
* **Example-Driven Learning:** The LLM analyzes example command snippets or code usage provided in the documentation to infer distinct operations. For instance, multiple examples using different flags for the same executable can highlight different features.

### 1.3. CLI Structure Interpretation
* **Sub-commands as Features:** For tools with complex CLIs (e.g., `docker image ls`, `docker container run`), each sub-command is often treated as a major feature.
* **Help Output Parsing:** The LLM parses the `--help` or `man` output for the main command and each sub-command to understand its specific purpose, arguments, options, and input/output patterns.

### 1.4. (Advanced) API Endpoint Analysis
* **Applicability:** For libraries or tools exposing local/network APIs.
* **Methods:**
    * Parsing formal API specifications (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger).
    * For code libraries (e.g., Python), static analysis of public function/method names, parameters, and docstrings, augmented by LLM interpretation.
* **Goal:** To identify granular functions that can be exposed as individual, invokable features.

### 1.5. Synthesizing and Structuring Features
* **Consolidation:** The LLM gathers all information to create a structured list of identified features.
* **Structured Feature Entry:** Each feature is cataloged with attributes such as:
    * `feature_id`: Unique identifier.
    * `name`: Human-readable name (e.g., "Resize Image," "Generate PDF from Text").
    * `description`: Detailed explanation of the feature.
    * `invocation_pattern`: Template for how to trigger the feature (e.g., command line with placeholders, function call signature).
    * `inputs`: Specific inputs required (name, type, description).
    * `outputs`: Expected outputs (type, description).
    * `tags/keywords`: For categorization and easier discovery.
* **Storage:** This structured feature list is associated with the tool's profile within AURA (e.g., enhancing its `aura_skill.json`).

## Phase 2: Collaborative Utilization Definition

With a catalog of discovered features, AURA, through its "Persona Weaver," initiates a conversation with the user to define how these features should be employed. This goes beyond the tool's original design, enabling AI-driven creative usage.

### 2.1. Presenting Discovered Features & User Verification
* **AURA's Presentation:** "I've analyzed '[ToolName]' and it appears to have the following key features: [List of features with brief descriptions]. Does this align with your understanding, or are there other important functions I should know about?"
* **User Feedback:** The user validates, corrects, or adds to the list, ensuring accuracy.

### 2.2. Exploring Modes of AI Interaction & Creative Usage
* **AURA's Suggestion:** "I can use these features directly if you ask. However, we can also explore more advanced ways for me to leverage '[ToolName]'. For example:
    * **Automated Workflows:** Chaining multiple features, possibly from different tools (e.g., 'For all `.docx` files in this folder, convert them to PDF using [ToolName], then extract the text from each PDF using my text extraction skill').
    * **Conditional Logic:** Triggering features based on conditions (e.g., 'If an image's resolution is above 4K, use [ToolName]'s downscaling feature before processing').
    * **Component Re-purposing:** 'The [ToolName] has an excellent audio normalization algorithm. Could I use just that component for other audio tasks, even if it's not a standalone feature?'"
* **User Brainstorming:** The user shares their goals and how they envision AURA using the tool's capabilities to assist them.

### 2.3. Defining Custom "AI Actions" or "Recipes"
* **Goal-Oriented Actions:** Based on the discussion, AURA helps the user define higher-level, intent-based actions.
* **Example:** "You mentioned you often need to prepare images for web use by resizing and compressing them. We can create a custom action called 'Prepare Image for Web'. When you request this, you'll provide the image, and I'll use [ToolName]'s resize feature followed by its compression feature with your preferred settings. How does that sound?"
* **Storage & Mapping:** These "recipes" are stored by AURA, linking natural user intents to specific sequences of operations, potentially involving multiple features, tools, or internal AURA skills.

### 2.4. Specifying Parameters, Defaults, and Preferences
* **Efficiency:** "For common tasks like '[Specific Task with ToolName]', are there default settings or parameters you'd like me to use unless you specify otherwise?"
* **Personalization:** Allows for quicker interactions for routine operations.

### 2.5. Iterative Refinement & Continuous Learning
* **Adaptability:** "Our understanding of how to best use '[ToolName]' can evolve. As you work with me, if you find new ways I could utilize its features, or if your needs change, please let me know. We can update its integration and our custom actions anytime."
* **Feedback Loop:** Ensures AURA's use of tools remains aligned with the user's evolving requirements.

## Benefits of This Approach

* **True AI Leverage:** Moves beyond simple command execution to intelligent, context-aware application of software capabilities.
* **User-Centric Design:** Tailors tool usage directly to the user's specific workflows, preferences, and creative ideas.
* **Enhanced Flexibility:** Supports standard tool use, complex automated sequences, and innovative re-purposing of tool sub-components.
* **Proactive Assistance:** AURA can suggest ways to use tools that the user might not have considered.
* **System Adaptability:** As the user's needs evolve, or as AURA learns more, these utilization patterns can be dynamically updated.

By combining automated feature discovery with deep, conversational user engagement, AURA aims to transform any integrated piece of software into a powerful, customized extension of its own AI capabilities, truly reflecting the user's intent and maximizing the utility of available tools.
